# **Logo Generator Assignment**

## **Assignment Intention**

For this assignment:

- I was attempting to create a command-line application that generates an SVG logo for the user.
- This application utlizes the inquirer package and has utilized Jest for unit testing.
- The app generates a logo using 3 selected characters, a shape and two colors (one for text, one for shape) to create the logo.
